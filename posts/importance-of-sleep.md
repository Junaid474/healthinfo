Sleep is as important for good health as diet and exercise. Good sleep improves your brain performance, mood, and health.

## The Science of Sleep

During sleep, your body works to support healthy brain function and maintain your physical health. In children and teens, sleep also helps support growth and development.

### How Much Sleep Do You Need?

Most adults need between 7 and 9 hours of sleep per night. Children and teenagers need even more.

## Tips for Better Sleep

*   Stick to a sleep schedule.
*   Create a restful environment.
*   Limit screen time before bed.
*   Avoid caffeine and alcohol in the evening.

Prioritize your sleep and watch your health improve!
